\section{Example sentences}
\label{apx:sentences}
List of example sentences used for evaluation. The checkmark is present if there is no false trees that get a higher probability than the real tree and if not the other parser performs better, that is, if one of the methods has assigned the same probability to a large set of trees while the other assigns it to only a correct subset of this set, then only the latter gets a checkmark.
