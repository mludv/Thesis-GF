  journal={{WMT@} {EMNLP}},
  abstract={Abstract This paper describes the {GF} Widecoverage {MT} system submitted to {WMT} 2015 for translation from English to Finnish. Our system uses a interlingua based approach, in which the interlingua is a shared formal representation, that abstracts syntactic structures over multiple languages. Our final submission is a reranked system in which we combine this baseline {MT} system with a factored {LM} model.},

  title={From Abstract Syntax to Universal Dependencies},
  journal={{LiLT} {(Linguistic Issues in Language Technology)}},
  abstract={Abstract Abstract syntax is a semantic tree representation that lies between parse trees and logical forms. It abstracts away from word order and lexical items, but contains enough information to generate both surface strings and logical forms. Abstract syntax is commonly used in compilers as an intermediate between source and target languages. Grammatical Framework {(GF)} is a grammar formalism that generalizes the idea to natural languages, to  ...},

  title={Fast Statistical Parsing with Parallel Multiple {Context-Free} Grammars.},
  journal={{EACL}},
  abstract={Abstract We present an algorithm for incremental statistical parsing with Parallel Multiple {Context-Free} Grammars {(PMCFG).} This is an extension of the algorithm by Angelov (2009) to which we added statistical ranking. We show that the new algorithm is several times faster than other statistical {PMCFG} parsing algorithms on real-sized grammars. At the same time the algorithm is more general since it supports non-binarized and non-linear grammars.},

Grammatical Frameword (GF) is introduced as an approach that uses type theory to provide high-quality translation between multiple languages. GF translation is fundamentally grammar-based but can be combined with statistical methods such as learning translation models from a corpus and ranking translation candidates by probabilities.",
